<h3><a name="User_Requirements_Notation_URN"></a><a name="User_Requirements_Notation_URN_"></a> User Requirements Notation  (URN) </h3>
jUCMNav is a graphical editor and an analysis and transformation tool for the <em>User Requirements Notation</em> (URN). URN is intended for the elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements. URN combines modelling concepts and notations for <em>goals and intentions</em> (with GRL, mainly for non-functional requirements and quality attributes) and <em>scenarios</em> (with UCM, mainly for operational requirements, functional requirements, and performance and architectural reasoning). In particular, URN has concepts for the specification of goals, non-functional requirements, rationales, behaviour, scenarios, and structuring. URN allows software and requirements engineers to discover and specify requirements for a proposed system or an evolving system, and analyse such requirements for correctness and completeness. URN is applicable within standards bodies and industry. It helps to describe and communicate requirements, and to develop reasoning about them. The main applications areas include telecommunications systems, services, and business processes, but URN is generally suitable for describing most types of reactive systems and information systems. The range of applications is from business goals and requirements description to high-level design.
<p />
<h3><a name="The_Goal_oriented_Requirement_La"></a> The Goal-oriented Requirement Language  (GRL) </h3>
<h4><a name="GRL_in_a_Nutshell"></a> GRL in a Nutshell </h4>
The <em>Goal-oriented Requirement Language</em> is a graphical language for supporting goal-oriented modelling and reasoning about requirements, especially non-functional requirements and quality attributes. It provides constructs for expressing various types of concepts that appear during the requirement process. GRL has its roots in two widespread goal-oriented modelling languages: i* and the NFR Framework. Major benefits of GRL over other popular notations include an integration with a scenario notation and a clear separation of model elements from their graphical representation, enabling a scalable and consistent representation of multiple views/diagrams of the same goal model.
<p />
<h4><a name="Why_use_the_Goal_oriented_Requir"></a> Why use the Goal-oriented Requirement Language? </h4> <ul>
<li> Goals become an important driver for requirements elaboration. Yet, stakeholders goals and objectives are complex and will conflict
</li> <li> GRL expresses and clarifies tentative, ill-defined and ambiguous requirements <ul>
<li> Models goals and their importance to stakeholders
</li> <li> Supports argumentation, negotiation, conflict detection &amp; resolution, and in general decisions
</li> <li> Captures decision rationale and criteria (documentation!)
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> GRL identifies alternative requirements and alternative system boundaries
</li> <li> GRL provides clear traceability from strategic objectives to technical requirements
</li> <li> GRL allows reuse of stable higher-level goals when the system evolves
</li> <li> GRL strategies help visualize satisfaction levels related to high-level decisions
</li> <li> Nothing like this in UML...
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="The_Use_Case_Maps_UCM_Notation"></a> The Use Case Maps (UCM) Notation </h3>
<h4><a name="UCMs_in_a_Nutshell"></a> UCMs in a Nutshell </h4>
The <em>Use Case Map</em> notation is a graphical language that employ scenario paths to illustrate causal relationships among <em>responsibilities</em>. UCM models provide an integrated view of behaviour and structure by allowing the superimposition of scenario paths on a structure of abstract components. The combination of behaviour and structure enables architectural reasoning after which UCM specifications may be refined into more detailed scenario models such as MSCs and UML sequence diagrams, or into state machines in SDL or UML statechart diagrams and finally into concrete implementations. Validation, verification, performance analysis, interaction detection, and test generation can be performed at all stages. Thus, the UCM notation enables a seamless transition from the informal to the formal by bridging the modeling gap between goal models and natural language requirements (e.g. use cases) and design in an explicit and visual way. The UCM notation allows the user to delay the specification of component states and messages and even, if desired, of concrete components to later, more appropriate, stages of the development process. The goal of the UCM notation is to provide the right degree of formality at the right time in the development process.

<h4><a name="Why_use_Use_Case_Maps"></a><a name="Why_use_Use_Case_Maps_"></a> Why use Use Case Maps? </h4> <ul>
<li> Bridge the modeling gap between use cases, requirements, and design <ul>
<li> Link behavior and structure in an explicit and visual way
</li> <li> Provide a behavioral framework for making (evaluating) architectural decisions at a high level of design
</li> <li> Characterize the behavior at the architecture level once the architecture is decided
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Convey a lot of information in a compact form
</li> <li> Use case maps integrate many scenarios <ul>
<li> Enables reasoning about potential undesirable interactions of scenarios 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Provide ability to model dynamic systems where scenarios and structures may change at run-time <ul>
<li> Business processes
</li> <li> E-commerce applications, Web services
</li> <li> Distributed systems based on agents
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Effective learning tool for people unfamiliar with the domain

<p /> <ul>
<li> In Eclipse, one must understand that all files and folders must be in projects. You can create a new project by using a wizard: File -&gt; New -&gt; Project.  <ul>
<li> Choose Simple -&gt; Project.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Once a project is created, select it and create a new jUCMNav file (*.jucm) <ul>
<li> File -&gt; New -&gt; Other
</li> <li> jUCMNav -&gt; Use Case Map / GRL Graph, Click next.
</li> <li> Choose the containing project and name your .jucm file.
</li> <li> Select whether you want the URN model to include a default UCM and/or GRL diagram.
</li> <li> Click finish.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Later, you can open and close files by using the Navigator view. You can also use the File -&gt; Import wizard to import existing files from the file system into your Eclipse workspace.  
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="Perspectives"></a> Perspectives </h4> <ul>
<li> Now that you have an open file, you might be wondering why your interface does not look exactly like the screenshots below. This is because Eclipse uses <em>perspectives</em> to layout all the windows in the interface. Perspectives can be saved, reset and changed.  <ul>
<li> jUCMNav has its own perspectives (one for regular editing as in the first screenshot, the other for scenario execution as in the second screenshot).  <ul>
<li> Window -&gt; Open Perspective -&gt; Other
</li> <li> Choose jUCMNav (or jUCMNav Execution). 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Later, you may return to another perspective by using the alternatives presented in the Windows menu bar or by clicking on the &gt;&gt; button at the top right of your screen.

</li> <li> Furthermore, the toolbar contains a back and next arrow to browse through your navigation history. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="References_versus_Definitions"></a> References versus Definitions </h4> <ul>
<li> Some UCM and GRL constructs use references and definitions (UCM components, UCM responsibilities, GRL actors, GRL intentional elements, and GRL links). 
</li> <li> When creating a reference, you also create a new definition. See the Outline view for a list of all definitions in a model. 
</li> <li> You can drag and drop a definition from the Outline view (in the UCM/GRL definitions section) to the editor.
</li> <li> All references must be associated to a definition, but not all definitions must have references. 
</li> <li> Unreferenced GRL/UCM definitions are grayed out in the Outline view
</li> <li> You can change the associated definition of a reference in the Properties view.
</li> <li> Properties such as name and descriptions are stored in the definitions. Modification of these properties update all references.
</li> <li> Note that definitions must have unique names. 
</li></ul>

</li> <li> You may also click and drag when inserting to resize it on creation. 
</li> <li> If you click anywhere on the component/actor reference, it is selected.
</li> <li> Once selected, you can move the component/actor in the editor. 
</li> <li> If you click on the bounds of the component/actor, you may resize it. 
</li> <li> When creating a component or actor, a label will be created automatically.
</li> <li> The label represents the name of the component/actor definition. If you change the name field in the properties, you will change the definition's name. All references in the editor will be updated.
</li> <li> You can also double click on a label to change it directly in the editor. 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Other properties <ul>
<li> You can change the fill and line color of references in the properties. All references will be updated. Note that if filled is false, the fill color will be ignored; the component/actor will appear transparent. 
</li> <li> Components can have different kinds. You can change the component kind in the properties. Changing the kind will have a visual impact on the figure. 
</li> <li> One cannot move or resize fixed components/actors. 
</li></ul>

</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Inserting path elements <ul>
<li> To insert path elements on a path, simply select the path element in the palette and click on the node connection on which it is to be inserted.
</li> <li> As with component references and definitions, the responsibilities that are inserted on a path are references. See the components section for more information about references versus definitions. 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Decomposition_Dependencies_and_C"></a> Decomposition, Dependencies, and Contributions (GRL) </h3> <ul>
<li> Creation <ul>
<li> Links can be created between intentional element. To create a link, select the type (Decomposition, Contribution, or Dependency). Then, click on start element and on the destination element. 
</li> <li> Only one link can be create between two elements.
</li> <li> Links are created using references and definitions. 
</li> <li> Contribution levels are set through the Properties view.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Elements_bound_to_components_UCM"></a> Elements bound to components (UCM) / actors (GRL) </h3> <ul>
<li> By default, any element moved onto a component/actor is bound to it. 
</li> <li> When bound, elements are moved and resized automatically if one moves or resizes the parent. 
</li> <li> If you move a component/actor behind other elements, these will not be bound. Automatic binding occurs when moving elements onto components/actors.
</li> <li> If you wish to bind these other elements to a component/actors, you may use the contextual menu option to do so.
</li> <li> One can bind/unbind an element from its parent using either the contextual menu or property page. 
</li> <li> One can bind/unbind all enclosed elements from a component/actor using the contextual menu. 
</li> <li> Note the special behavior concerning fixed components/actors.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Working_with_labels_UCM_GRL"></a><a name="Working_with_labels_UCM_GRL_"></a> Working with labels (UCM/GRL) </h3> <ul>
<li> Some labels are created automatically when an element is created: start points, end points, responsibilities, stubs, components, actors.
</li> <li> These labels contain the name of the element. 
</li> <li> They can be moved around freely. When the labelled element is moved, the labels will move as well.
</li> <li> You can hide these labels by deleting them (contextual menu or delete key).
</li> <li> The name of the element can be changed directly in the editor by double clicking on the label. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Forks_Joins_UCM"></a><a name="Forks_Joins_UCM_"></a> Forks/Joins (UCM) </h3> <ul>
<li> To insert a fork or join on a path, you can use the palette and do as you would with any other path node.
</li> <li> You can also use the palette and insert them directly on an empty point.
</li> <li> The contextual menus also allow you to replicate the same behaviour.
</li> <li> It is also possible to drag and drop a start point on a node connection or empty point to form an OR fork. The same is applicable for an dragging an end point on a node connection or empty point and creating an OR join.
</li> <li> If you need to change an OR fork/join into an AND fork/join, use the contextual menu.
</li> <li> Additional branches can be inserted on forks and joins using the contextual menu or by using the same drag and drop technique illustrated above. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Conditions_UCM"></a><a name="Conditions_UCM_"></a> Conditions (UCM) </h3> <ul>
<li> The node connections exiting OR forks, timers and waits can have conditions that will be illustrated visually.
</li> <li> To insert a condition, select the node connections and modify its properties. You must change the label field to the condition you want to be displayed. The expression field is used for scenario evaluation.
</li> <li> Start points can have pre-conditions and end points, post-conditions. The behaviour is the same. 
</li> <li> To hide a condition label, change its text to an empty string or delete it. 
</li> <li> See the scenario portion of this guide to learn more about the syntax of conditions in jUCMNav. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Deletion_UCM_GRL"></a><a name="Deletion_UCM_GRL_"></a> Deletion (UCM/GRL) </h3> <ul>
<li> You can select an element and use the contextual menu or press the delete key to remove it from the URN diagram. If a reference is deleted, its definition is not affected.
</li> <li> You can select multiple elements using your mouse or the select all option and delete them all.
</li> <li> You can delete elements via the outline, but can only delete definitions that have no references. 
</li> <li> UCM <ul>
<li> If a stub, join or fork is deleted, the existing branches will be truncated. 
</li> <li> You can delete a portion of a path by deleting its start point or end point. 
</li> <li> If only one entry/exist path subsists for a join/fork, it will be replaced with an empty point.
</li> <li> If no entry paths and no exist paths subsist for a stub, it will be deleted as well. 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> GRL <ul>
<li> Deleting an intentional element reference delete all the link references associate to the element. The link definition is deleted if the model does not contain other references to the link. 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Waiting_places_timers_and_connec"></a> Waiting places, timers and connects (UCM) </h3> <ul>
<li> Timers can have a timeout path. Use the context menu to insert a timeout path. It has a special icon to help identify it. 
</li> <li> As mentioned previously, waiting places and timers have conditions. The timeout path condition is the logical opposite of the regular path's condition. Therefore, one cannot add a condition on the timeout path. 
</li> <li> To create a synchronous connection, select both an end point and a starting point, waiting place or timer to choose the connect elements option in the contextual menu.
</li> <li> Once connected, the path elements will move together. If they overlap, simply use the outline to select the one beneath to modify its properties. 
</li> <li> To disconnect the elements afterwards, use the contextual menu.
</li> <li> Asynchronous connections work similarly, but using an empty point and starting point, waiting place or timer. 
</li> <li> Drag and drop also works to create connections, for waiting places and timers only.

</li> <li> Preferences allow you to select the UCM elements to export, as well as the format of the page.
</li> <li> This export is work in progress. Among the current features present and missing: <ul>
<li> The report includes the list of UCM variables and scenarios, but neither their definitions nor their diagrams.
</li> <li> The results of GRL strategies is included in a table, but the GRL elements are not yet explained in the diagrams.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="GRL_Catalogues"></a> GRL Catalogues </h3> <ul>
<li> GRL catalogues are reusable high-level GRL models, often used to describe common model elements and relationships related to non-functional aspects. 
</li> <li> Catalogues are used to start new models or add concerns to existing ones. They consist of a XML file describing intentional elements and links (only contributions and decompositions are part of catalogues). 
</li> <li> To create a catalogue, in a URN model, use the export mechanism and choose to export the whole URN file. The file type is *.grl for catalogues.
</li> <li> To import a catalogue in a model, select import file in the contextual menu and select the .grl file to import.  <ul>
<li> The import mechanism creates all the intentional element and link definitions and create a new GRL diagram in model with all the imported elements and links. The autolayout is used to display the diagram. 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Metadata"></a> Metadata </h3>
<p />
<img alt="Metadata.png" src="Metadata.png" />
<p /> <ul>
<li> jUCMNav allows users to add metadata to any model element. Metadata information is a pair &lt;Name, Value&gt;, and many such pairs can be attached to a model element. This can be used in ad hoc analysis or transformations.
</li> <li> The Metadata Editor (above) is invoked by selecting a model element and right-clicking on the Edit Metadata item in the pop-up menu. 
</li> <li> The type of element (first pull-down menu) can be used as a filter. The second pull-down menu allows to select an element of the desired type.
</li> <li> The window includes a table that shows the name-value pairs attached to the model element. New ones can be added, and the existing ones can be edited and deleted.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h2><a name="Part_IV_GRL_Strategies"></a> Part IV GRL Strategies </h2> <ul>
<li> The concept of GRL strategies is a mechanism developed in jUCMNav to analyze GRL models using a set of user-defined evaluations. 
</li> <li> There are two evaluation labels use in strategies. One to evaluate the satisfaction level of intentional elements (goals, softgoals, resources and tasks) and one to calculate a global satisfaction value for actors.
</li> <li> GRL strategies are visualized using the execution view (selected in Scenarios and Strategies view). 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Quantitative_Evaluation"></a> Quantitative Evaluation </h3> <ul>
<li> jUCMNav uses a quantitative interpretation of the satisfaction levels. The values are between -100 (denied) and +100 (satisficed). The correspondence between quantitative and the qualitative is: <ul>
<li> Satisficed: 100
</li> <li> Weakly Satisficed: 1 to 99
</li> <li> Unknown: 0
</li> <li> Weakly Denied: -1 to -99
</li> <li> Denied: -100
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> In Execution mode, qualitative evaluations are displayed next to numerical evaluations. 
</li> <li> Default evaluation value is 0 (Unknown).
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Managing_Strategies"></a> Managing Strategies </h3> <ul>
<li> Strategy Creation/Deletion <ul>
<li> In the Scenarios and Strategies view, under GRL Evaluation Strategies, the contextual menu allows creating, deleting and duplicating evaluation groups and strategies.  
</li> <li> Evaluation groups are constructs to store one or more strategies. Strategies must be created in an evaluation group. 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Analyzing_GRL_models"></a> Analyzing GRL models </h3> <ul>
<li> Intentional elements and GRL strategies: <ul>
<li> Once a strategy is created, select it and switch to Execution view. For strategies without user evaluations, evaluations are 0 for all intentional elements and actors.
</li> <li> In the properties view, set the strategy properties (name, description and author). 
</li> <li> To set an evaluation for an intentional element, select the element in the editor. In the properties view, under Strategy, set the evaluationLevel property (between 100 and -100). The new evaluation is propagated to other elements using the links (contributions, dependencies, decompositions) associated to the intentional element definition. Note that user evaluations overwrite calculated evaluations. Elements with user-defined evaluations are identified with a star (*). 
</li> <li> To delete a user evaluation, select the intentional element. In the contextual menu, choose Delete User Evaluation. The calculated evaluation is restored and propagated. 
</li> <li> The default algorithm in jUCMNav calculates the evaluations using the following method:  <dl>
<dt> Decompositions</dt><dd> Decompositions are calculated as a standard AND/OR graph (as shown in the following figure). 
</dd></dl> 
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<img alt="AndOrDecomposition.JPG" src="AndOrDecomposition.JPG" />
<p /> <dl>
 <dd>
 <dl>
 <dd>
 <dl>
<dt> Contributions</dt><dd> Contributions must have a label other than "Unknown" to be used in the algorithm. The following diagram shows example of typical contributions for elements.
</dd></dl> 
</dd></dl> 
</dd></dl> 
<p />
<img alt="Contributions.JPG" src="Contributions.JPG" />
<p /> <dl>
 <dd>
 <dl>
 <dd>
 <dl>
<dt> Dependencies</dt><dd> An element that depends on others elements as an evaluation less or equal (&lt;=) to the minimal value of the elements it depends on. The following figure shows how dependencies are propagated. 
</dd></dl> 
</dd></dl> 
</dd></dl> 
<p />
<img alt="Dependencies.JPG" src="Dependencies.JPG" />
<p /> <ul>
<li> Actors and GRL strategies <ul>
<li> The actor evaluation label is calculated based on the bound intentional element references. It is displayed in a label at the top of actors in execution mode.
</li> <li> A priority and criticality is required for intentional element references to be considered in the actor evaluation. By default, all elements have a criticality and priority of "None", resulting to a value of 0 for actor evaluations. 
</li> <li> Elements with highest priority and criticality have the most influence on evaluations. 
</li> <li> Priority and criticality must be set for each reference.
</li></ul> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Exporting_Strategies_in_CSV"></a> Exporting Strategies in CSV </h3> <ul>
<li> Suppose you have a dozen strategies defined for your model. Having screenshots is not very helpful in comparing all of them at the same time (especially when you have many diagrams). jUCMNav hence allows you to export the evaluations of all the strategies in a .csv file that you can then import in Excel to get a nice, tabular view of everything that happens. <ol>
<li> Right-click on URNspec in the Outline view and select Export
</li> <li> In the export wizard, select <em>Export the whole URN file</em> and click Next.
</li> <li> In the next page, select the <em>Comma-separated Values - GRL Strategies (.csv)</em> option in the File type selection box.
</li> <li> Also choose the target directory and file name and click Finish
</li> <li> (optional) In Excel (or similar tool), open the .csv file just generated. You now have a tabular representation of the satisfaction levels for all elements, per strategy!
</li></ol> 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<p />
<h3><a name="URN_Links"></a> URN Links </h3>
<p />
<img alt="URNlink.png" src="URNlink.png" />
<p /> <ul>
<li> URN links are a new construct in URN introduced in jUCMNav to create traceability links between UCM and GRL views. jUCMNav supports links from GRL actors and intentional elements to UCM maps, components and responsibilities. 
</li> <li> Links are managed from the GRL diagram. To manage the link, select an actor or an intentional element. In the contextual menu, select Edit URN Links.
</li> <li> Current links for the selected element are displayed at the left. A link can be deleted by selecting it in the list and clicking on the Delete Link button. 
</li> <li> To create a new link, select the element type, the element name, and click on Add link. Note that only 1 link by UCM element is supported. 
</li> <li> Once links are created, a yellow triangle is displayed in the element labels on both GRL and UCM views. 
</li> <li> Links can be used to evaluate the impact of GRL strategy on UCM model. In execution mode, GRL intentional element evaluations are associated to their link destination elements. Associated evaluations are displayed in UCM element labels. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h2><a name="Part_V_UCM_Scenarios"></a> Part V UCM Scenarios </h2> <ul>
<li> Scenarios execute a UCM model and highlight the traversed path in the diagrams. One can then verify that the traversal matches with the intended behaviour and rectify the situation if this is not the case.
</li> <li> You first design model by creating scenario groups and scenarios (using the contextual menu) while in the design view of the Scenarios and Strategies view. When satisfied, you proceed to the execution view to see the impact of your work when it is simulated. 
</li> <li> A <a href="http://cserg0.site.uottawa.ca/twiki/bin/view/ProjetSEG/UcmVariableDemo" class="twikiLink">Flash demo on using scenario variables</a> and another <a href="http://cserg0.site.uottawa.ca/twiki/bin/view/ProjetSEG/UcmScenarioDemo" class="twikiLink">Flash demo on using UCM scenarios</a> are also available.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Code_and_Condition_Editor"></a> Code and Condition Editor </h3> <ul>
<li> Before executing your model, you must insert pseudo-code inside pre/post conditions and inside responsibilities (which change the internal state of the model). 
</li> <li> If you double-click on a condition or responsibility in the UCM, a pseudo-code editor will be opened. 
</li> <li> Some conditions are only available via the Properties view or the stub bindings view. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="Variables"></a> Variables </h4> <ul>
<li> jUCMNav supports Booleans, Integers, and User-Defined Enumerations. 
</li> <li> You may create these variables via the contextual menu of the Variable item in the Scenarios / Strategies treeview, or via the Create Variable Wizard, which is available in the pseudo-code editor. 
</li> <li> Modifications to the variables (names, descriptions, etc.) can be done through the Properties view.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="Scenario_children"></a> Scenario children </h3>
<h4><a name="Start_Points"></a> Start Points </h4> <ul>
<li> Start points are what launches a scenario. The default traversal algorithm executes them sequentially, in the order that they are defined (you can re-order them with the move up / move down contextual menu items). Other algorithms may decide to launch them in parallel. The same start point can be used many times in a scenario. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="End_Points"></a> End Points </h4> <ul>
<li> End points are defined as targets for the execution. These are points that must be traversed by the algorithm. Others may also be reached, but this is the minimum set. If they are not reached, errors appear in the Problems view. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="Variable_initializations_precond"></a> Variable initializations, preconditions and postconditions </h4> <ul>
<li> Each scenario has a variable initialization wizard that will, simply put, initialize the variables before launching the start points. 
</li> <li> Scenario preconditions / postconditions are conditions that are evaluated at the scenario level. Once again, errors will appear in the Problems view if they are not true. 
</li> <li> Start points and end points can also have preconditions and postconditions associated with them. These are distinct from the scenario level ones. 
</li> <li> Depending on the algorithm settings defined in the preference page, an invalid precondition can either permanently abort a path or simply block it until the condition becomes true. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="Included_Scenarios"></a> Included Scenarios </h4> <ul>
<li> Included scenarios prevent from having to redefine the same elements in multiple scenarios. Scenarios will respect the start points, end points, variable initializations, preconditions and postconditions of the included scenarios. 
</li> <li> A scenario can override initializations but can only append to the other scenario children.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Executing_a_Scenario"></a> Executing a Scenario </h3> <ul>
<li> To execute a scenario, activate the execution view by clicking on its icon in the scenarios / strategies view. Then, click on a scenario and it will be automatically executed. If you change anything in the map, you may need to use the refresh toolbar button. Select another scenario to execute it.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h4><a name="Detecting_Problems"></a> Detecting Problems </h4> <ul>
<li> The traversal algorithm notes problems during the execution of the scenario in the Problems view. 
</li> <li> Double click on the problem to focus the editor at the appropriate location. Some items have quick fixes (right click on the problem and choose the quick fix operation).
</li></ul>

<p />
<img alt="jucmnav_traversalprefs.jpg" src="jucmnav_traversalprefs.jpg" />
<p /> <ul>
<li> Maximum number of times an element can be hit before it is declared blocked: This integer helps trap infinite loop conditions. The lower it is, the more restricted your models will be, but the quicker infinite loops will be found. 
</li> <li> Should we include GRL intentional elements as variables for UCM scenarios?: If this checkbox is set, jUCMNav will automatically create an integer variable for each GRL intentional element. When a strategy is executed, the variables are overridden with the propagation results and can be use to guide conditions in UCM. Furthermore, responsibilities can modify them, which will modify the satisfaction levels in the GRL graph. The order in which the scenario and strategy are executed impacts the behaviour. This is currently only a prototype. 
</li> <li> Should we continue other processing and come back to the element later if its precondition is false?: If this checkbox is set, the default scenario traversal algorithm is said to be patient. For example, it will wait for false preconditions to become true before launching a start point. 
</li> <li> Deterministic algorithm: If the algorithm is deterministic, in certain situations where multiple alternatives could be taken but only will be selected, such as when an or-fork with multiple true out paths is reached, the chosen path will always be the same. Otherwise, it would pick one randomly.

<h2><a name="Part_VI_MSC_Viewer"></a> Part VI MSC Viewer </h2> <ul>

</li></ul> 
<p />
<img alt="MSC.png" src="MSC.png" />
<p /> <ul>
<li> To generate an MSC from a UCM, do the following after executing a scenario, File -&gt; Export, Export UCM/GRL/URN, Export Whole URN
</li> <li> Choose file type: Export Scenarios and select a directory/filename.  <strong>Be careful!</strong> Depending on your export preferences, you may override the existing file should you enter the same filename. 
</li> <li> The resulting export depends on the scenario export preferences <ul>
<li> Export type <ul>
<li> *.jucmscenarios will generate an MSC viewable by jUCMNav's MSC Viewer. 
</li> <li> Linearized *.jucm file will generate a flat UCM representing the scenario execution. Auto-layout will have to be performed to be able to visualize the results. 
</li> <li> Well-formed linearized *.jucm file will generate a flat UCM representing the scenario execution. Well-formed refers to the fact that it can be expressed in a linear form, which is required for MSCs. Please note that this step possibly includes additional concurrency constraints, changing the interpretation of the original model. Auto-layout will have to be performed to be able to visualize the results. 
</li> <li> Typically, when generated MSCs are considered inaccurate, it is because of the additional concurrency constraints that this algorithm MUST add in order to represent the execution trace as an MSC. A warning is given to the user when such situations occur.
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Export what <ul>
<li> All scenarios: all scenarios are exported
</li> <li> Last run scenario only: only the last run scenario is exported. 
</li></ul> 
</li> <li> Automatically open editor after export: if the exported file is located inside the Eclipse workspace, setting this flag will automatically open it after exporting.

<h2><a name="Part_VII_Static_Semantics_Checki"></a> Part VII Static Semantics Checking Tool </h2>
<p />
jUCMNav allows modellers to perform static verification on URN models based on user-defined rules. Rules are described in the Object Constraint Language (OCL). They are invariants described in terms of the metaclasses found in <a href="http://cserg0.site.uottawa.ca/twiki/bin/view/ProjetSEG/URNMetaModel" class="twikiLink">jUCMNav's metamodel</a>. This functionality is available on jUCMNav version 3.1 and above.
<p />
<h3><a name="Creating_a_rule"></a> Creating a rule </h3> <ul>
<li> Example rule:  <em>There should be no containment cycles in UCM components.</em>
</li> <li> Rule properties <ul>
<li> <strong>Rule name</strong>: It must be unique in the system. For example, <em>UCM_NoComponentCycle</em>
</li> <li> <strong>Rule classifier</strong>: Packagename::Classname, to specify the object's type on which the rule is applied. For example, <em>ucm::map::ComponentRef</em>
</li> <li> <strong>OCL context expression</strong>: Creating a rule on a particular type means that each instance of this type must be conform to the constraint that the rule implies. Therefore, to ensure the rule is not violated, we must check if every instance of the type conforms to the constraint. Based on <a href="http://cserg0.site.uottawa.ca/twiki/bin/view/ProjetSEG/URNMetaModel" class="twikiLink">jUCMNav's metamodel</a>, all instances of all types except the URNspec are contained in the singleton instance of URNspec (the current model). From URNspec, we can collect all instances of a particular type by using an "OCL navigation path". For example, to collect all instances of the type Responsibility in UCM, from the instance of URNspec, we specify the navigation path <em>self.urndef.responsibilities</em>. We call this navigation path <em>Rule Context Expression</em>, which must return a sequence of objects with a type specified by Rule Classifier. For example,          <em>self.urndef.specDiagrams-&gt;select(d|d.oclIsTypeOf(ucm::map::UCMmap)).contRefs-&gt;select(r|r.oclIsTypeOf(ucm::map::ComponentRef))-&gt;collect(o|o.oclAsType(ucm::map::ComponentRef))</em>
</li> <li> <strong>OCL invariant expression</strong>:  This describes the precise semantics of the rule using an OCL expression. It is as same as the <strong>inv</strong> part in an OCL expression. For example,   <em>not(self.ancestors()-&gt;exists(ar|ar.contDef.oclAsType(urncore::ComponentElement).id=self.contDef.oclAsType(urncore::ComponentElement).id))</em>
</li> <li> <strong>Rule description</strong>: This describes the human readable semantics of the rule. For example, <em>There should be no containment cycles in UCM components.</em> This is also used as an error message in the Problems view when the rule is violated.
</li> <li> <strong>Rule utilities</strong>: User-defined operations used to simplify the logic of OCL invariant expression. They are similar the <strong>def</strong> part in an OCL file. For example,

<h2><a name="Part_VIII_Key_Performance_Indica"></a> Part VIII Key Performance Indicators </h2>
As of version 3.0, jUCMNav supports extensions to model Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to provide business process monitoring and performance management capabilities, as well as enabling the alignment of processes and goals.
<p />
<img alt="KPI.png" src="KPI.png" />
<p /> <ul>
<li> The GRL palette was extended to support Indicators, Dimensions, and KPI Model Links (linking indicators to the dimensions of interest for analysis). GRL models can hence be turned into performance models. 
</li> <li> KPIs can be set up through the Properties view.
</li> <li> Two new views were added (see below).
</li> <li> More information available in <a href="http://jucmnav.softwareengineering.ca/twiki/bin/view/UCM/VirLibPChenThesis07" target="_top">Chen's thesis</a>. A <a href="http://cserg0.site.uottawa.ca/twiki/bin/view/ProjetSEG/KPIDemo" class="twikiLink">Flash KPI Demo</a> is also available.
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="List_of_Key_Performance_Indicato"></a> List of Key Performance Indicators view </h3> <ul>
<li> To manage KPIs and KPI groups, a KPI list view presents users with an overview of categorized KPIs. 
</li> <li> Users can also create their own groups in the KPI list view. Four groups of performance dimensions are created by default: cost, time, quality and flexibility.
</li> <li> To assign or remove KPI groups on a selected KPI, the use can select Edit Indicator Group in the Indicator contextual menu (on the diagram or in the list of KPIs), or select the Indicator and use the Properties view.
</li> <li> If a GRL strategy is being defined/evaluated, for each indicator the target value, the threshold value, the worst value, the evaluation value and the unit of the indicator can be set through the Properties view. Also, the level and value of dimensions for each KPI information element can be set through the Properties view.
</li> <li> After KPI models are defined and KPI strategies are created, KPI values then can be retrieved through the monitoring services by clicking on the button <em>Retrieve KPI values</em> (top-right corner of the list of KPIs view). The KPI evaluation module includes an interface defined for requesting KPI values so that the interface can be implemented in different ways to obtain KPI values. In this implementation, a Web services client serves as the interface to facilitate the communication with the external monitoring services. To connect to the monitoring services, the URL of the monitoring services is set in jUCMNav's KPI monitoring preferences page in the Eclipse tool.
</li> <li> After the KPI values are retrieved and applied to each KPI in each strategy, the KPI evaluation values can be transformed to GRL evaluation levels and then used for propagation to generate evaluation levels on higher level goals.
</li> <li> After a specific evaluation strategy is selected, the KPI evaluation status is shown in the List of KPI view as icons with different colors, in which the red-down arrow means poor performance, the green-up arrow means acceptable or satisfied performance and the yellow arrow means the performance just meets the threshold value. 
</li></ul> 
<p />
<h3><a name="Key_Performance_Indicators_view"></a> Key Performance Indicators view </h3>
<p /> <ul>
<li> The KPI view is designed to present the details of KPI evaluation status visually so that when a user selects any GRL/UCM element or map that has KPIs defined or linked either directly or indirectly, the KPIs' evaluation status will be displayed in the KPI view to present a general performance view of that process or goal. 
</li> <li> The URN editors, the GRL strategy view, the KPI list view and the KPI view are synchronized to present an overview of process and goal evaluation from different perspectives. 
</li> <li> Business processes and goals can be linked by URN links, thus KPIs defined for goal models can also be linked to processes. In this case, when users trigger a strategy and choose a process element, the linked KPIs are shown in the KPI view and the satisfaction level of the connected goal element will be displayed on the target process element.
</li> <li> A detailed KPI evaluation status shows the KPI information, such as its name and the description, the groups and the evaluated tasks are presented to users, along with the strategy information, such as the dimensions, the unit, the target, threshold, worst and evaluation values. 
</li> <li> The values are color-coded and shown graphically.
